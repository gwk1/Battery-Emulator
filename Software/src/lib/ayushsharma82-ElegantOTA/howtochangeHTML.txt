Modifying HTML for the ElegantOTA Library

This guide provides the necessary steps to update and modify the HTML used in the ElegantOTA library. 
Follow these steps carefully to ensure that your changes are properly integrated.

Steps to Modify the HTML:

1 - Edit the CurrentPlainHTML.txt:

Locate the file CurrentPlainHTML.txt in your project directory.
Modify the HTML content as needed. This file contains the plain HTML code that will be served through the OTA interface.

Convert the HTML to GZIP and Decimal Format:

Copy the content of the updated CurrentPlainHTML.txt.
Navigate to the CyberChef tool for encoding and compression.
Apply the following recipe:
Gzip with the "Dynamic Huffman Coding" option enabled.
Convert to Decimal with a comma separator.
Use this link for the process: https://gchq.github.io/CyberChef/#recipe=Gzip('Dynamic%20Huffman%20Coding','','',false)To_Decimal('Comma',false)

2 - Update the ELEGANT_HTML Array:

Copy the resulting decimal output from CyberChef.
Replace the existing content of the ELEGANT_HTML array in elop.cpp with the new decimal data from CyberChef.

3 - Adjust the ELEGANT_HTML Array Size:

After updating the ELEGANT_HTML array in both elop.h and elop.cpp, update the array size to match the length of the new output from CyberChef.
Ensure that the array size reflects the new length of the compressed HTML to avoid errors during compilation.
